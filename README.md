# minitalk_42
Minitalk is a 42 project that implements a simple client-server communication system using UNIX signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2). The server receives messages from the client, which are transmitted one bit at a time using signal encoding. The project demonstrates low-level inter-process communication (IPC) and signal handling in C.
